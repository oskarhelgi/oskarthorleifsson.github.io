##### Abstract:

This paper studies the role of mismatch between unemployed job seekers and vacancies in shaping unemployment and post-unemployment outcomes. We build measures of how well job-seekers align with available vacancies and apply them to a sample of Danish UI recipients. We quantify the importance of mismatch to vacancies on several margins, including job finding, earnings, and occupational relocation. Workers who are mismatched with vacancies find a job slower and have lower earnings post-employment, even three years after unemployment entry. Furthermore, we exploit access to data on job applications submitted by unemployed workers to analyse the type of jobs targeted. We find an initial difference in the characteristics of jobs mismatched workers apply for. However, the change in application behaviour over the course of the unemployment spell is similar for mismatched workers and better matched workers. Lastly, we attempt to answer whether mismatched workers search differently in a way that alleviates adverse outcomes. By relying on counterfactual job-finding probabilities, we provide suggestive evidence that although mismatched workers direct a larger share of applications to unrelated jobs, this does not seem to translate into faster job finding.
